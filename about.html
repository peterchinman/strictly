      <h1 class="loud-voice">Meter</h1>
      <p class="body-copy">Meter in English is usually thought of as consisting of sequences of stressed and unstressed syllables.</p>
      <p class="body-copy">Let us consider the following line:</p>
      <p class="body-copy">'He wants to see a flamingo.'</p>
      <p class="body-copy">We could analyze the meter in either of these two ways:</p>
<pre class="mono block-quote">
 x  /     x  /  x   x /  x
he WANTS to SEE a flaMINgo

 /  x     x  /  x   x /  x
HE wants to SEE a flaMINgo
</pre>
      <p class="body-copy">Things to observe. Single syllable words have ambiguous stress. There are some... general patterns. You could try to come up with rules, or, train a LLM on it. But you're always going to have sentences like this, where altering the meter is a matter of shifting our attention around in a sentence.</p>
      <p class="body-copy">Another thing to observe: 'flamingo' always has the same stress pattern. Try to pronounce FLAminGO. The mouth resists. This is a general pattern: multisyllabic words have stresses that are more baked-in. Some multi-syllabic words are differentiated entirely by their stresses. Take CONFLICTS. As in “global CONflicts” and “that conFLICTS with my schedule”.</p>
      <p class="body-copy">There is some flexibility in multisyllabic words, e.g. I can hear INTRICATELY with either a stressed or unstressed final syllable, i.e /xx/ vs /xxx.</p>
      <p class="body-copy">All of those poses problems for any sort of algorithmic meter detection. What I've aimed for with this tool is more of a "meter validator". It doesn't aim to tell you what the true meter of a line of text is, but rather, if a line of text could fit a specific meter.</p>
      <p class="body-copy">It accomplishes this by ignoring single syllable words, which as we've shown, have irreducibly ambiguous meters, and instead focuses on validating that the multi-syllablic words have stresses in the correct places.</p>
      <p class="body-copy">I'm using the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary for this project. It is not comprehensive. I'm interested in incorporating machine learning in order to come up with a "best-guess" stress pattern for unfamiliar. But that has not been implemented yet.</p>
      <p class="body-copy">I do have some concern that this app will train people to think of poetic forms as "rules you have to follow". They are organizing principles, not laws. Deviation is encouraged.</p>
