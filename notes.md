# TODO

- [ ] check poem line length
- [ ] check stanza line length
- [ ] set up repeating rhyme
- [ ] hover tool tips over indicators
- [ ] input validation
  - [ ] meter and syllable length need to match
- [ ] meter should check for syllable, right?

# Known Bugs
- [ ] selecting Sonnet and then increasing syllable count causes four indicators to appear

  - [ ] should also trigger re-checking subsequent lines, if differing lines is checked
