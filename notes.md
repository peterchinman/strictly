# notes from presenting at UI meeting

don't need toggle switches!
just the inputs.

more guidance.
poetic forms to pre-load the form with at the top.
   e.g. "sonnet" will populate the fields
      # of lines: 14
      rhyme scheme: ABBA CDDC EFFE GG
      meter: x/x/x/x/x/
   e.g. "limerick", emily dickinson verse, etc etc

a guided user journey where it walks them thru by asking them questions
and then at the end there is a configuration document that user can adjust
