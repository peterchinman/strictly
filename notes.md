# notes from presenting at UI meeting


A guided user journey where it walks them thru by asking them questions
and then at the end there is a configuration document that user can adjust?

# TODO

- [x] legend for indicator colors
  - [ ] Have them dynamically appear and disappera
- [ ] check poem line length
- [ ] check stanza line length
- [ ] set up repeating rhyme
- [ ] tool tips
- [ ] input validation
  - [ ] meter and syllable length need to match
- [ ] meter should check for syllable, right?


selecting Sonnet and then increasing syllable count causes four indicators to appear
